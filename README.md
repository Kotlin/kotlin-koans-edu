# kotlin-koans-edu

Kotlin Koans are a series of exercises to get you familiar with the Kotlin Syntax.
Each exercise is created as a failing unit test, and your job is to make it pass.
You can work with Kotlin Koans in one of the following ways:

* You can play with Koans online: https://play.kotlinlang.org/koans/overview.
* You can solve the tasks right inside IntelliJ IDEA or Android Studio by
[installing the EduTools plugin](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/education/install-edutools-plugin.html?section=IntelliJ%20IDEA)
and [choosing Kotlin Koans course](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/education/learner-start-guide.html?section=Kotlin%20Koans).

You don't need this project if you want to solve the tasks. Install the educational plugin or do it online.
