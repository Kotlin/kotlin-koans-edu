## Comparison

Learn about [operator overloading](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/operator-overloading.html)
and how the different conventions for operations like `==`, `<`, `+` work in Kotlin.
Add the function `compareTo` to the class `MyDate` to make it comparable.
After this the code below `date1 < date2` should start to compile.

Note that when you override a member in Kotlin, the
[`override`](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/classes.html#overriding-members)
modifier is mandatory.
