## Rename on import

When you [import](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/packages.html#imports)
a class or a function, you can specify a different name for it
by adding `as NewName` after the import directive.
It can be useful if you want to use two classes or functions with similar names
from different libraries.

Uncomment the code and make it compile.
Rename `Random` from the `kotlin` package to `KRandom`,
and `Random` from the `java` package to `JRandom`.
