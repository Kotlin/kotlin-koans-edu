## Compound tasks

Implement two functions:
- The first one should find the most expensive product among all the *delivered* products
ordered by the customer. Use `Order.isDelivered` flag.

- The second one should count the amount of times a product was ordered.
Note that a customer may order the same product several times.

Use the functions from the Kotlin standard library that were previously discussed.

You can use the `Customer.getOrderedProducts()` function
defined in the previous task (copy its implementation).
