## Html builder

_1._ Fill the table with the proper values from the product list.
The products are declared in [data.kt](data_file).

_2._ Color the table like a chess board (using getTitleColor() and getCellColor() functions above).
Pass a color as an argument to the functions `tr`, `td`.

Open the file `demo.kt` and run the main function there to see the rendered table.
